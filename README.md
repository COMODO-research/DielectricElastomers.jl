# DielectricElastomers.jl
This project features Julia code for the analysis of the static and dynamics of dielectric elastomers. 

__Dielectric elastomers (DEs) are smart material systems that produce large strains and are promising for Soft robotics, Artificial muscle, etc. They belong to the group of electroactive polymers (EAP).__ For more details, please refer to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_elastomers)

DielectricElastomers.jl uses the power of [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/),  [BifurcationKit.jl](https://bifurcationkit.github.io/BifurcationKitDocs.jl/stable/), and [DynamicalSystems](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystems.jl/dev/)

This package supports the following plots 

- [X] Time History
- [X] Phase Space
- [X] Poincaré Map
- [X] Stretch-Voltage Plot
- [X] Fast Fourier transform (FFT)
- [X] Lyapunov Exponent
- [X] Bifurcation Diagram of Poincaré Map
- [ ] Frequency Response
- [ ] Force Response
